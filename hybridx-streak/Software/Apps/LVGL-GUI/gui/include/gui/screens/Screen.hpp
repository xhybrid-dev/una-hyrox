/**
 ******************************************************************************
 * @file    Screen.hpp
 * @brief   Base class of every HybridXRace screen.
 *
 * A Screen owns one LVGL screen object (lv_obj_create(nullptr)), receives the
 * kernel's button codes through LV_EVENT_KEY on that object, and is the
 * Model's listener while it is on display. This plays the role TouchGFX's
 * View + Presenter pair play in the Run app, collapsed into one class:
 * onShow() is the presenter's activate(), onHide() its deactivate().
